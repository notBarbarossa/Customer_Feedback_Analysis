Suren Kunwar,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I placed an order through the app,"I placed an order through the app, and due to a wrong location pinned (which was entirely my mistake) the food went to the wrong address. No problem, these things happen. The courier guy called me and informed me that the food had been returned to the restaurant. I thought, okay, But when I called the restaurant to confirm, they said they never received the food back. Confused, I called the courier guy again, and this time, he changed his story completely. Now, he claimed that the food had been disposed because it couldn’t be delivered. First, it was returned to the restaurant and now it’s been thrown away? Which one is it?
                       

                       To make matters worse, when I reached out to the customer service team for clarification and resolution, I was met with indifference. No proper explanation, no accountability, and no effort to make things right. It’s not about the money, it’s about the principle. When we order food, we trust the company to handle our orders responsibly. If a mistake happens, we expect transparency and a genuine effort to resolve the issue.
                       

                       This experience has left me questioning the reliability of the entire process. If the support team were honest they would have definitely investigated the case with courier guy. Do you really think that the courier guy had disposed the food what was prepared just 20 minutes ago??

Stinky Shrimp,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Worst Customer Support I EVER had in my life.,"The worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life – seriously, even the stinky fish pavilion at the Central Market is a gold standard compared to this trash. Your Indian couriers are completely incompetent creatures with zero language skills – not Latvian, not Russian, not English. They can’t drive, don’t know traffic rules, cause accidents every single day, and drive around in half-broken, life-threatening wrecks that look like they were dug straight out of a Finnish junkyard. Literally brain-dead animals with IQ lower than a rubber boot. A classic Bolt Food experience: the restaurant receives the order, prepares it quickly and on time, marks it as “Ready for pickup,” and then the circus begins. Every damn time, the dumbass courier spends 40-50 minutes circling around the restaurant like a complete idiot (I can see it live in your app), while the food gets cold and disgusting. When they finally pick it up, it takes another 30 minutes to get to my door, and then the next circus act starts: they can’t find the address, can’t read house numbers, even if the GPS pin is accurate to the millimeter. Or even better – they text, “I am here,” while they’re sitting in their car a kilometer away and don’t even bother looking for the entrance. The result? I get cold, disgusting food, and very often, something is missing because these brain-dead thieves just steal it. And then we get to your “customer support” (or a wall that it would be more productive to bang my head against). The AI robot replies with the same useless, pre-written templates that solve absolutely nothing. I write, “Connect me to a real person,” 99 times, and when it finally happens, that so-called “person” just repeats the same idiotic scripts and closes the chat before I can even respond. Reopen the chat? The cycle starts over, and in the end, they might throw you one euro. One bloody euro! This isn’t customer support; it’s mockery. Compared to Wolt and their flawless service, Bolt Food, you are cripples, completely useless and shameful. All my friends have already deleted your app and accounts because they got tired of this stinking garbage. I held out as long as I could, only because one specific restaurant isn’t available on Wolt. But now, you’ve fully earned your disappearance from the market. I wish you total bankruptcy. Your attitude is disgusting, your service is below rock bottom, and you are a disgrace to this century with your couriers, pathetic scooters, horrible wages, and treatment of drivers. You are the trash of the food delivery industry.","January 26, 2025"

So deal with that. Bye.""
                       

                       Frustrating. Yes, we know some people abuse of the refund process. But, with the historic they can easily catch the issues and see that the time is completely overpass. Bolt food Lisboa : BIG delay without ANY resolutions.","January 24, 2025"

I spoke to the agents Liz and Sixtus 3 times where in the first occasion they advised they had a tech issue and money will be reverted. It wasn’t so i contacted them again. I was told this was escalated and i should see my money within 5business days. Didnt happen of course. So back to support where the same agent said it wont be returned.

Needless to say I did not find the food there. Honestly it’s not just that, their customer service is horrendous. Non existent, I asked to speak to a human thinking ‘any human with some common sense will take accountability on behalf of the company for supposedly delivering to the wrong address’,  but I was wrong.

Deniz,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Terrible Experience with Bolt Food - Dishonest and Unprofessional Support,"I had a horrible experience with Bolt Food on 29th September 2024. I placed an order (Order #OK7OX) that was delayed for over 2.5 hours with no updates. The moment I connected to a support agent, my order was suddenly canceled. The agent, Faith, claimed it was automatically canceled due to the delay, but what a ""coincidence"" that it happened just as I connected with them! I found this extremely suspicious.
                       

                       To make matters worse, the agent was dismissive and rude. After telling me my order was canceled, they tried to end the chat immediately with a ""Have a lovely evening"" before I could even respond. I had to reconnect to support, wasting more time, just to get basic information.
                       

                       I repeatedly asked for a contact email to escalate my complaint, but they refused to provide one, avoiding the request and giving irrelevant responses instead. I understand that delays happen, but the combination of poor communication, unprofessional support, and dishonesty made this an awful experience.
                       

                       I expected better from a service like Bolt. I was refunded, but that does not compensate for the time wasted and the stress caused by their poor handling of the situation. I asked for a goodwill gesture, but nothing was offered.","September 29, 2024"

After that, he couldn't find my home (although I wrote my address very accurately and in detail). So I was waiting for my order for 1.5 hours AFTER the order was completely ready!

Second, i asked for refund in bolt support, because after 2 hours we were not needed in this food, we were forced to prepare some food by ourselves.

Sissi,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,They don't refund missing items - scammers!,"I was pretty often a customer on Bolt Food and Bolt (drive and taxi), but the last experience was compared to a scam scheme.
                       

                       I used to order a lot—I mean, A LOT—from Bolt Food, and unfortunately, most of the time, the restaurants send the wrong items or items that are missing.
                       

                       This time, one of the associated restaurants forgot to send one of the 3 French Fries ordered.
                       

                       I contacted customer support via live chat, but they refused to refund me for the item I paid for but didn't receive, saying that ""you've reached the maximum compensation limit within a specific timeframe.""
                       

                       EXCUSE ME!
                       

                       So, to sum up, you're saying that it's MY fault that the restaurants send orders without double-checking if all items are enclosed? Really?
                       

                       From 01JUL to 13JUL, I've ordered 6x, a total of 204,74 EUR.
                       
                       From 01JUN to 30JUN, I've ordered 14x, a total of 479,56 + I've spent in Bolt Drive + taxi a total of 198,85. For June alone, I've spent 678,41 EUR with Bolt.
                       
                       In less than 2 months, I've spent 883,15 EUR with Bolt.
                       

                       In the last 20 orders, 5 came with missing items and 2 with wrong items. 35% of the orders of this period came with missing or wrong items, and you're saying that you aren't going to refund me anymore?
                       

                       Unfortunately, the app doesn't show the chats from previous months, so I can do a better calculation of how many orders have come incomplete since the beginning of this year (without counting 2022 and 2023).
                       

                       I had 35% bad experiences with your deliveries from 01JUN to 13JUL, and now I'm being financially penalized for an item that I paid for and didn't receive!
                       

                       It's scandalous! It's indecent! It's outrageous!
                       

                       Rest assured that I won't order through your app anymore because if a restaurant forgets an item again, I won't be refunded for it.
                       

                       Rest assured that I'm also raising a complaint with the police because you're scamming me; you're stealing my money!

                       My recent experiences with Bolt have been nothing short of a nightmare. From start to finish, this company has demonstrated an utter disregard for customer service, basic communication, and even common decency.
                       
                       Bolt's customer service representatives are the epitome of unhelpful. They frequently place you on mute, not to assist you,but seemingly to avoid having to actually do their jobs. When they do speak, their English is often so poor that it's impossible to have a meaningful conversation. They insist on communicating solely through the app, a tactic that only highlights their inability to handle customer issues effectively. And to top it off, the phone connection is consistently abysmal, making even the simplest interaction a frustrating ordeal.
                       
                       The drivers are no better. Many are shockingly rude. They often ignore the designated pick-up location, opting to go wherever they please just to cancel your trip to enjoy their £6. Attempts to communicate with them are futile, as their language skills are often nonexistent. Trying to decipher their broken English feels like a game of charades gone.
                       
                       Bolt's complete lack of professionalism, coupled with its woefully inadequate service, makes for a truly dreadful experience. It's clear that this company prioritizes profit over customer satisfaction, cutting corners at every turn.
                       
                       I urge everyone to think twice before using Bolt. If you value your time, your money, and your sanity, there are far better transportation options available.

                       The last garbage they came up with, that made me quit this scam app, is that they started artificially inflating the prices on food, so they can make ""promotions"" every day. 30% off, but the same dish is actually 10%-30% more expensive than last week, with the ""promotion"" applied. They also delete bad ratings from the app so all the garbage restaurants can have top rating, which I'm pretty sure is not legal. Again, Bolt blames the restaurant owners. I wonder why some very good restaurants just quit delivering with Bolt? Hmmm!

Ed,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Disastrous service and Unprofessional Support,"I must first begin by expressing my disgust with the disastrous and unprofessional service provided by Bolt Food Malta.
                       

                       My experience two years ago, as well as my recent encounter with their support team, exemplifies the asolute sheer lack of professionalism that seems to be ingrained within this food delivery service.
                       

                       Let me begin by recounting the nightmare of my last interaction with Bolt around two years ago. One late evening, I placed an order in the hopes of enjoying a decent meal. Though what I actually got was a late delivery and the wrong order. Despite their mistake, I remained polite, understanding and calm only for things to get worse when the delivery driver gave me the two options; either accept the wrong order and pay for it or send it back and wait for a refund.
                       

                       Given the late hour and closure of the restaurant, I requested a refund while reluctantly agreeing to accept the incorrect order out of hunger. The driver refused my request leaving me with no choice but to close the door without taking the food and insist on a refund.
                       

                       The following morning, when I attempted to place a separate order, I was confronted with a higher bill, and the driver informed me of the outstanding balance from the previous night's incident. Despite my attempts to explain the situation to the driver and clarify that I was only going to pay for the current order due to the ongoing case, he refused to give me the order until I settled the negative balance from the night before, in addition to the bill for that order. This left me with no choice but to walk away, ultimately resulting in a double negative balance on my Bolt account.
                       

                       When the support team finally acknowledged my messages in the chat later that afternoon, after a lot of struggle, they agreed to refund me for the first order, but they refused to acknowledge the situation regarding the second order, which I rightfully refused  to pay for due to the nature of the circumstances. Their refusal to acknowledge responsibility left me with no choice but to permanently disassociate myself from their service.
                       

                       Fast forward today, my recent experience with Bolt Food Malta only served to reaffirm my initial thoughts about their service. Despite reinstalling the app after two years and trying to redeem a voucher provided by my employer, I faced the same disappointing service. Even after reaching out to their support team about the ongoing negative balance I was dismissed once again and the chat was closed in my face.
                       

                       In short, the unreliability of Bolt, along with their inadequate support and disgusting service, serves as a prime example of how not to run business. I strongly advise ANYONE considering their service to steer clear and seek alternatives.","April 09, 2024"

Frequent problems with the delivery with the courier going elsewhere to deliver other orders with your order with him, and hence the food arriving cold, with soggy French fries etc. Today i ordered and the courier wasn’t budging to go get my order. We were starving so I contacted him. He answered he was coming but after 10 mn still didn’t move. I asked him again to come and his reaction was to cancel. So instead of letting the app look for another courier I asked support to cancel my order as I decided to go get it myself (restaurant close to my place). They said yes we cancel the order no problem. Then after 15 mn or so the courier arrives and I refuse the food given that the order is cancelled. I ask them what’s happening and they say oh sorry we made a mistake but now you will be charged for this order because “after checking” we see that you can’t cancel an order that’s already in preparation. So why didn’t you tell me that instead of accepting to cancel? Now I’m insisting to get my money back and they respond with automatic messages that state the same over and over. They hope I’ll get tired of insisting. But I refuse to pay for an order that THEY accepted to cancel.","February 29, 2024"

                       Food will remain fresh?

                       So I cancel the order but rider called me again and again and knocked my door again and again. It was my bad experience ever.
                       
                       After all that they made my bolt balance negative.

I told them about a meal that was delivered wrongly(not the same ingredients) and they were like: sorry, have 1 euro refund😁 like what? 1 euro is nothing compared to what I paid for a  not as advertised order and the amount of time I waited for it! But they would not budge, either woth upping the voucher amount or taking the order back( I informed them I had not touched it, so that they don t think I am scamming them out of a voucher or something).

Claudia Vbt,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Horrible experience,"Recently, I placed an order through a delivery service (Bolt), hoping for a convenient and hassle-free experience. However, things took an unexpected turn when the courier arrived at the venue to pick up my order. Instead of promptly delivering it, the courier inexplicably stood still for over 30 minutes. I decided to contact the courier to inquire about the delay, only to discover that he could only speak Russian, leaving me at a loss since I couldn’t communicate effectively in that language.
                       

                       Feeling rather frustrated, I attempted to seek assistance from the venue itself, hoping they could bridge the communication gap. Unfortunately, my efforts were in vain, as the staff member at the venue also lacked proficiency in English or Estonian, and was working alone.. limiting our ability to resolve the situation. Regrettably, it seemed that Russian was the only language spoken at both ends.
                       

                       Left with no other choice, I took matters into my own hands and decided to pick up my order from the Bolt Market myself. Because customer support of Bolt does not exist or does not work in weekends? From the limited communication with the venue I understood she was not able to get a hold on Support either (maybe good information to know for future companies thinking of going on Bolt).
                       

                       It was a disappointing outcome, as I had initially relied on the convenience and reliability of the delivery service. However, this experience serves as a reminder of how poor service Bolt provides as they only care about increasing the amount of green mess over the City streets (scooters)!
                       

                       Also refunds they do not give you can only get store credit. Please let it be a warning when using any service of them","July 16, 2023"
JL,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Recently,"I made a groceries order which ended up being over an hour late, but the delay was not properly communicated to me at all, meaning that I was sat watching the phone waiting for my order, seeing the delivery time get later minute by minute, having no idea when it would arrive. By the time it did over an hour later, I already had to leave for work and couldn't accept the delivery.
                       

                       At no point was it made clear to me just how delayed the actual delivery time would be, and by this point, it was too late for me to cancel as it became clearer that i wouldn’t receive the order in time before I had to leave.
                       

                       I reached out to the in-app Help Centre, and I emailed Bolt Portugal customer support, and they initially refused to refund me and have stopped replying.
                       

                       Absolutely appalled at the customer service, truly unacceptable especially in a country where 40 euros is a LOT of money for most people. If Bolt make a mistake with communication around an order meaning the order couldn't be received, then Bolt should be liable for the money paid by the customer. End of.

                       I ended up driving to the restaurant and learnt that the Bolt platform allows drivers to cancel the order, once they have collected it.  Our delivery man was waiting for our order, whilst someone else as per the security footage, already collected our food.
                       

                       As Bolt refunded as on the app, the restaurant had to remake our order which I paid for with the waiter.
                       

                       Despite my efforts to support the restaurant being reimbursed by Bolt, due to their poorly designed app, Bolt has opted to ignore my messages.

In my recent order I ordered three burgers and 3 french fries. After having received my order and seen the total I could not figure out the ridiculous cost (they charged me double).

Yet they marked the order delivered and imposed a charge for the order that wasn’t even left with me, as the coffee no longer resembled the chiller I ordered, all the ice having long melted.

mohammad moattarzadeh,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,excellent service and friendly customer support,"I have been using Bolt Food app for almost 2 years. so far I have received very good service, or better to say the best service on the island between all food delivery apps available.
                       
                       keep up the good work guys. well done","July 24, 2022"
Dhr. Kristof Renotte,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Awful experience,"Awful experience, customer service is not smart saying an item is not available. They deliver something else but refuse a refund. So be careful you might order fish, get meat but no refund.","July 13, 2022"

Ruth Kanyua,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,The most unreliable food App in the…,I ordered food. The restaurant accepted the order. After that the restaurant called me and said they where out of the food I ordered. Contacted Bolt and Bolt said it was not possible to cancel or refund the order once the restaurant had accepted the order. What a scam! Avoid Bolt!,"July 03, 2022"
Olof,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,No refunds!,"If I could give -5 stars I would. I am currently staying in a hotel in a foreign country and decided to order food.
                       
                       Details for the courier were as follows;
                       
                       Please call me when you arrive to the hotel lobby.
                       
                       Next thing that happens is I get a notification that my food has been delivered. I call the courier who says they have dropped off the delivery. I called back asking for more info.
                       
                       When asking why did they not follow the instructions, they responded they tried to call. This is a lie and I would be happy to provide my call logs as I had the phone in front of me the whole time. No calls.
                       
                       When I contact support, they respond with automated macro-responses that they are sorry and would like to offer a refund. I waited for 30 minutes for the food to be delivered to the wrong dude. Not once was I offered that the order would be sent again.
                       
                       The refund will take up to 30!! days to be processed.
                       
                       When asking for the name of the customer support agent, they did not respond.
                       
                       I have used Bolt Food for a very long time, quite often the food arrives cold, but it still arrives.
                       
                       This is by FAR the worst experience I have ever had when ordering food.
                       
                       STAY CLEAR OF BOLT FOOD!","June 20, 2022"
Ilmar Mikael Sinisalu,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,If I could give -5 stars I would,"🚨Worst experience ever - I’m a customer for a long time with bolt food and ordered a meal which was disgusting and didn’t match the description. It mentioned comes with French fries but instead I received potato chips.
                       

                       1. On menu it was not visible which fries I would get
                       
                       2. Description mentioned French fries.
                       

                       I reached out to the support team and got connected by a agent called Victor which was very unhelpful and didn’t refund my order while it should have been. It’s just stealing as I got something I didn’t order at all! 😡
                       

                       I’m very displeased as I’m ordering almost daily! If this support agent had some brains he would have understood that customer service is key especially for loyal customers…","April 11, 2022"

Paula,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,DON’T USE BOLT FOOD.,"We used to order daily, sometimes multiple times a day, but the drivers and customer service are unbelievable. More than one hour waiting for a delivery because the driver was picking up and doing deliveries with another app while my food was ready and waiting. On another occasion I had to go and pick up the food myself due to the same reason. Customer support is suppose to answer in 5 min but they take their own sweet time and fix nothing. They only say they’re sorry. Sometimes they will refund but then again the same problem would happen so they don’t really care about fixing the issues. Tired of having pay for a service that really sucks, having to wait for food for hours without even being able to order from somewhere else because they would not cancel. DON’T USE BOLT FOOD!","March 17, 2022"

prabhu srikanth,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Worst experience,"Delivery took way too long, the restaurant itself messed the order up (restaurants fault of course, but bolt is the middle man). Got a refund which was a fraction of the sum paid. Overall, if available in your country, go for Wolt. No issues, amazing customer support, full resolutions to issues.
                       

                       With bolt food - issues. Every time. Will cease to use this service starting today. Thank you for nothing.","February 19, 2022"
Artūras Puodžiūnas,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,A ridiculously bad experience,"Delivery times do not match. Despite planing it properly, the courier came in less than half of the estimated time and because I couldn't pick up the order at that time, it was cancelled with no right to refund.
